solution of many mysteries;of the profound sadness which had,
from the first of my acquaintance with him, possessed a man so
gorgeously endowed as the favorite of nature and fortune; of his
motives for huddling up, in a clandestine manner, that connection
which formed the glory of his life; and possibly (but then I
hesitated) of the late unintelligible murders, which still lay
under as profound a cloud as ever. Much of this WOULD be unveiled
all might be: and there and then, with the corpse lying beside me
of the gifted and mysterious writer, I seated myself, and read the
following statement:


"MARCH 26, 1817.

"My trial is finished; my conscience, my duty, my honor, are
liberated; my 'warfare is accomplished.' Margaret, my innocent
young wife, I have seen for the last time. Her, the crown that
might have been of my earthly felicityher, the one temptation to
put aside the bitter cup which awaited meher, sole seductress (O
innocent seductress!) from the stern duties which my fate had
imposed upon meher, even her, I have sacrificed.

"Before I go, partly lest the innocent should be brought into
question for acts almost exclusively mine, but still more lest the
lesson and the warning which God, by my hand, has written in blood

"That account of my history, and my prospects, which you received
from the Russian diplomatist, among some errors of little
importance, is essentially correct. My father was not so
immediately connected with English blood as is there represented.
However, it is true that he claimed descent from an English family
of even higher distinction than that which is assigned in the
Russian statement. He was proud of this English descent, and the
more so as the war with revolutionary France brought out more
prominently than ever the moral and civil grandeur of England.
This pride was generous, but it was imprudent in his situation.
His immediate progenitors had been settled in Italyat Rome first,
but latterly at Milan; and his whole property, large and scattered,
came, by the progress of the revolution, to stand under French
domination. Many spoliations he suffered; but still he was too
rich to be seriously injured. But he foresaw, in the progress of
events, still greater perils menacing his most capital resources.
Many of the states or princes in Italy were deeply in his debt;
and, in the great convulsions which threatened his country, he saw
that both the contending parties would find a colorable excuse for
absolving themselves from engagements which pressed unpleasantly
upon their finances. In this embarrassment he formed an intimacy
